# SOLIDWORKS_Modeling
# My computer with my past SOLIDWORKS work was corrupted, and thus those files were lost. This portfolio is incomplete for now but I am in the progress of restoring these files

Design work done with the SOLIDWORKS modeling software. I believe I am a solid modeler, but as is evident in this file my surface modeling is a weak point I am working toward fixing.

MECH_201 Will include work done for my MECH_201 design course at CSU. It will also include my SOLIDWORKS CWSA certificate

Self_Work Has SOLIDWORK work I have completed on my own time from my own sketches and practice, including sketches done. This is excluding any work I have that I look to eventually market or sell for obvious privacy reasons, so the file is smaller than the true extent of my personal work

Self_Practice includes practice projects, some guided and some not, as is indicated in the name of the assignment.
